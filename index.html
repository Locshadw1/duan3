      The demon king has been defeated, and the victorious hero party returns
      home before disbanding. The four‚Äîmage Frieren, hero Himmel, priest Heiter,
      and warrior Eisen‚Äîreminisce about their decade-long journey as the moment
      to bid each other farewell arrives. But the passing of time is different
      for elves, thus Frieren witnesses her companions slowly pass away one by
      one. Before his death, Heiter manages to foist a young human apprentice
      called Fern onto Frieren. Driven by the elf's passion for collecting a
      myriad of magic spells, the pair embarks on a seemingly aimless journey,
      revisiting the places that the heroes of yore had visited. Along their
      travels, Frieren slowly confronts her regrets of missed opportunities to
      form deeper bonds with her now-deceased comrades.

      The Republic of San Magnolia. For a long time, this country has been
      besieged by its neighbor, the Giadian Empire, which created a series of
      unmanned drones called the Legion. After years of painstaking research,
      the Republic finally developed autonomous drones of their own, turning the
      one-sided struggle into a war without casualties‚Äîor at least, that's what
      the government claims. In truth, there is no such thing as a bloodless
      war. Beyond the fortified walls protecting the eighty-five Republic
      territories lies the "nonexistent" Eighty-Sixth Sector. The young men and
      women of this forsaken land are branded the Eighty-Six and, stripped of
      their humanity, pilot the "unmanned" weapons into battle... Shinn directs
      the actions of a detachment of young Eighty-Sixers while on the
      battlefield. Lena is a "handler" who commands the detachment from the
      remote rear with the help of special communication. The farewell story of
      the severe and sad struggle of these two begins!

      Young Thorfinn grew up listening to the stories of old sailors that had
      traveled the ocean and reached the place of legend, Vinland. It's said to
      be warm and fertile, a place where there would be no need for fighting‚Äînot
      at all like the frozen village in Iceland where he was born, and certainly
      not like his current life as a mercenary. War is his home now. Though his
      father once told him, "You have no enemies, nobody does. There is nobody
      who it's okay to hurt," as he grew, Thorfinn knew that nothing was further
      from the truth. The war between England and the Danes grows worse with
      each passing year. Death has become commonplace, and the viking
      mercenaries are loving every moment of it. Allying with either side will
      cause a massive swing in the balance of power, and the vikings are happy
      to make names for themselves and take any spoils they earn along the way.
      Among the chaos, Thorfinn must take his revenge and kill Askeladd, the man
      who murdered his father. The only paradise for the vikings, it seems, is
      the era of war and death that rages on. [Written by MAL Rewrite]
